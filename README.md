# Semi-supervised Impedance Inversion by Bayesian Neural Network Based on 2-d CNN Pre-training
This code is written for the manuscript: Semi-supervised Impedance Inversion by Bayesian Neural Network Based on 2-d CNN Pre-training. 

There are three folders in the project. In "core" part, there are some basic functions used in this project.

In "Marmousi2" part, the Bayesian neural network for Marmousi2 is built as is described in the manuscript. In "SEAM" part, the same is done for SEAM model. 

This project references the work of Alfarraj and AlRejib: https://github.com/motazalfarraj/Semi-supervised-Learning-for-Acoustic-Impedance-Inversion.
